Description: Provides a list of functions for the Bayesian modeling of
    archaeological chronologies. The Bayesian models are implemented in
    'JAGS' ('JAGS' stands for Just Another Gibbs Sampler. It is a program
    for the analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. See <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/>
    and "JAGS Version 4.3.0 user manual", Martin Plummer (2017)
    <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/Manuals/>.). The
    inputs are measurements with their associated standard deviations and
    the study period. The output is the MCMC sample of the posterior
    distribution of the event date with or without radiocarbon
    calibration.
