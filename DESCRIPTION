Description: Provides a list of functions for the Bayesian modeling of
    archaeological chronologies. The Bayesian models are implemented in
    'JAGS' (Plummer 2003). The inputs are measurements with their
    associated standard deviations and the study period. The output is the
    MCMC sample of the posterior distribution of the event date with or
    without radiocarbon calibration.
